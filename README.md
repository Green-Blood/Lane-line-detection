# Lane-line-detection
## Capstone design Term Project
##### Lane-line detection using OpenCV and python. 

###### For vehicles to have the option to drive without anyone else, they have to comprehend their encompassing world like human drivers, so they can explore their way in avenues, delay at stop signs and traffic lights, and abstain from hitting deterrents, for example, different vehicles and walkers. In view of the issues experienced in recognizing objects via self-governing vehicles, an exertion has been made to exhibit path discovery utilizing the OpenCV library. The explanation and method for picking grayscale rather than shading, distinguishing edges in a picture, choosing the area of enthusiasm, applying Hough Transform, and picking polar arranges over Cartesian directions have been talked about.
